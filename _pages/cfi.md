Aiming to contribute to the recent series of open research initiatives within the machine learning community (for instance, one can take a look at [the open problems from COLT](https://learningtheory.org/colt2023/cfp.html#openproblems), the [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/) initiative, or on Twitter [1](https://x.com/BlancheMinerva/status/1741855005601141091), [2](https://x.com/ziv_ravid/status/1780297953782984953)), the workshop will feature a poster session devoted to presenting ideas for collaborations, positions, and open challenges. The papers should be related to bridging the gap between experimental and theoretical reinforcement learning (see [Call for Papers](/cfp) for the range of topics) and should include:
- A clear definition of the problem/idea/position.
- The motivation for studying the problem/idea/position and why it is important for the machine learning community.
- The current state of the problem/idea/position.

The submitted papers can either be problems/ideas/positions novel to the community, or problems/ideas/positions already proposed in published works. Submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee. All accepted papers will have a poster presentation. Please note that at least one author of each accepted paper must be available for the poster and/or oral presentation. There will be no proceedings.

<h2>Important dates</h2>

<h2>Submission instructions</h2>

The page limit is 4 pages (excluding references and the appendix). Submissions may include supplementary material, but reviewers are only required to read the first 4 pages. Submissions should use the template provided by the [adapted NeurIPS 2024 style files](/assets/files/arlet2024_style.zip). The title should start with "Open Problem:", ”Idea:”, or ”Position:”. The reviewing process is double-blind, so the submissions should be anonymized and should not contain information that could identify the authors. Parallel submissions (to a journal, conference, workshop, or preprint repository) are allowed.
